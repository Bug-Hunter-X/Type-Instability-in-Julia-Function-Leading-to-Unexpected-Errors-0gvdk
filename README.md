# Type Instability Bug in Julia

This repository demonstrates a common type instability bug in Julia, leading to unexpected errors and performance issues.

The `bug.jl` file contains a function (`myfunction`) that exhibits type instability. The `bugSolution.jl` file provides a corrected version of the function.

## Bug Description
The original function (`myfunction` in `bug.jl`) suffers from type instability because the return type changes depending on the input.  This makes the function less efficient, particularly when used with large arrays.

## Solution
The solution in `bugSolution.jl` addresses the type instability by explicitly specifying the return type as `Float64`. This ensures consistent typing and improves performance.

## Running the Code
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open Julia and navigate to the directory.
3. Run the code in `bug.jl` and observe the error.
4. Then run the code in `bugSolution.jl` to see the corrected behavior.

## Discussion
Type stability is crucial for performance in Julia.  Ensure that functions consistently return the same type, regardless of the input.
